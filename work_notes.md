Building a real deployed full-stack application, backed by Data Science


Note - assignments this week are all steps in a larger week-long project. They are to be worked on in a repo you make with your own account, as instructed in the first day. You should still fork this repo, and open a PR where you add a work_notes.md file that includes a link to your project repo. You should then update work_notes.md each day with the following:

    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
